## 📝 About the Project

**HeroAPI** is a robust backend solution designed to manage hero data through a powerful RESTful API.

## 🚀 Technologies Used (Backend)

The current core technologies used in this repository are:

- **TypeScript:** Used for type safety and scalability.
- **Node.js:** The JavaScript runtime environment.
- **NestJS:** A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable and scalable server-side applications.
